# react-udemy-projects

Projects I'm doing as I go through React and Redux courses on Udemy, as part of Stephen Grider's courses on React and Redux

### Projects

1.  **Conponent Structure:** A basic demonstration of component refactoring and resuability.
2.  **Class-based components:** Working with class-based components and understanding component lifecycle and state.
